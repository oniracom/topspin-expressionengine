* After copying files, login to your control panel and click 'install' next to the Topspin module
* Click on 'Topspin' in the control panel and enter your credentials
* After you save your credentials, a list of artists associated with your account will populate
* Choose an artist, save and then you can begin creating store pages by choosing a URL and setting up your offer filters

CUSTOMIZING INSTRUCTIONS
===
* The module will create a template group called '_topspin_stores' with the two default templates, light and dark.
* You can edit these templates directly to match the style of your site
* You can also create a new template and associate one of your store pages to it through the pages module
